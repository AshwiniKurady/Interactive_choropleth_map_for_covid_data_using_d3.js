Following is the list of updates on the implementation :
\begin{itemize}
\item Data has been taken from The Covid Tracking project and choropleth map has been implemented in d3.v5. The data only contains statewide information and does not have county-wise split-up. Hence, the choropleth map shows the color coding for positive cases (by default) based on states.
\item Cumulative plots are added where clicking on any state will show the Covid trend in each state – 5 different plots are shown for the different metrics like number of positive, negative, total tests, total recovered and number of deaths. It is possible to compare data between states by clicking on different states. Double clicking on the map clears all the plots.
\item Buttons are added to switch the data being displayed to negative cases, total number of recovered, number of tests etc. The color coding changes based on the data being displayed along with the legend scale.
\item Hovering over the states (mouseover) brings up a pop-up showing the details for the particular state. This includes the data for the latest date (two days prior data is chosen as latest date to allow time for data to be uploaded fully).
\item State and county borders are shown though county information is not processed. Handling county information needs input from different sources. This can be tricky since data may not correlate exactly between different sources.
\item Two lookup tables are used in this project – One (lookup.csv) to generate the population data for different states [cite] (in order to calculate the per Capita information) and the second one (stateLookup.csv) to map fips codes to state code and the state names.
\item In order to read json and csv files, since the browser does not allow accessing local files, a local server had to be created following the steps shown in \cite{server}. The server was created using the web sever extension for Chrome. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Timeline}
\label{sec:timeline}

The milestones along with the description of what is achieved in each of them is shown below :

\paragraph{Milestone 1}
\begin{itemize}
\item Loaded the geographic dataset into Topojson format. The Topojson format helps in encoding geometric features such as point, line string, multiline string using coordinats that each of them feature.
\item Create SVG canvas for the map.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Milestone 2}

\begin{itemize}
\item Turned the Topojson data into screen co-ordinates using built-in projections in d3\cite{proj}.
\item To set up the path generator and its dimensions \cite{geoPath}.  This helps to generate the path data string as an attribute for SVG path element.
 \item binding the data to SVG.
\item Progress Update
\item Added data to the map(by creating the g element and append the path element)
\item Added interactions to the map by using page elements to pop information on the map.(eg: adding page elements to display the count of covid cases in each state on the map)
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Milestone 3}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added zoom on feature to make the visualization more interactive specially for north eastern states which are small to hover on.
\item Parsed the data more efficiently and having a lookup for multi-data handling.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Milestone 4}
\begin{itemize}
\item Added cumulative data instead of single date - to show choropleth map for the latest date and add onclick function to show progression from early on till date.
\item Compare statistics of any number of states by clicking on states and viewing the cumulative plots of each state which range from March to the current date.
\item Choropleth map is automatically updated to the latest date by extracting the latest data from the COVID Tracking Project to showcase latest trend of COVID spread.
\item Project report and documentation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Changes from original plan}
\label{sec:changes}

\begin{itemize}
\item Additional features require zip-code and weather data which were planned as possible enhancement to the visualization if time permits. However, there is no correlation obtained to the spread of Covid to weather and hence, this metric was dropped due to not being as relevant.
\item Adding county wise split up of cases was another possible enhancement. While this is possible, the variance in the datasets for statewise [cite] and county-wise [cite] data due to being from different sources means that there are possibilities of mis-representing the data. Hence, only data from one source [cite] was used and as a result, state wise split up of cases is shown.
\item Addition of specific correlation plots between metrics – while direct correlation plots are not included, decision was made to include cumulative plots for different metrics on clicking a particular state. This was because, with different metrics, generating cumulative plots provides more information regarding the progression and adding correlation plots explicitly would lead to over-crowding. It is quite intuitive to look at the cumulative plots and look at the correlation between different metrics.
\end{itemize}
